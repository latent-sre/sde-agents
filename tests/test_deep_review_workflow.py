"""Executes the shipped deep-review workflow the way the Workflow runtime does.

`workflows/deep-review.js` has shipped unloadable twice — once with the lane constants declared
ahead of `export const meta`, once deriving them FROM `meta`. Both parse as valid JavaScript and
read as configured in review; the runtime extracts `meta` statically and evaluates the body with
that export isolated, so the second shape died at every invocation with "meta is not defined"
(2026-08-09, CLI 2.1.226, run wf_c1db8dfb-b9f) with zero agents spawned and no install-time error.

`scripts/validate_fleet.validate_workflow_meta_contract` catches that class lexically and
documents its own limit: "Nesting a template or extra braces inside an interpolation stays out of
this flat scan's reach -- a missed exotic nesting is a silent non-fire." This module narrows that
limit by execution instead of pattern-matching: the body is isolated from `meta` exactly as the
runtime isolates it, then run under Node against stubbed `agent`/`parallel`/`phase` primitives, so
any surviving reference throws here instead of in production. The gap is real rather than
theoretical — this body line passes the whole validator clean and dies here with the historical
"ReferenceError: meta is not defined" (mutation-proven when this module landed):

    const label = `${ ({}).nope ?? meta }`

Narrows, not closes: the two instruments are complementary rather than nested, and one compound
shape defeats both. `_META_EXPORT` below ends the export at a column-0 `}`, so a `meta` reformatted
without one (a single-line object) lets the lazy match run past it and silently delete a body
prefix. On its own that still fails loudly, and the validator catches it — but a deleted prefix
whose only `meta` reference is nested-brace-template-shaped is invisible to both at once
(independently reproduced at verification, 2026-08-10). A brace-matching end anchor, the depth
count the validator already carries, would retire the hole; it is unbuilt, so the boundary is
stated here rather than implied away.

Node is an external binary, not a repository dependency: a machine without it skips.
