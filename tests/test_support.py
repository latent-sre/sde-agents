"""Tripwires for the shared fixtures in tests/support.py — above all the pooled repo copy.

`repo_copy` promises every borrower a provably pristine tree while reusing one working copy.
A restore bug would not fail the test that hits it; it would leak one test's mutation into the
next and weaken the wiring suite silently — the exact failure mode the mutation tests exist to
prevent. So each mutation type a borrower can perform (change, add, delete, and the same-size
rewrite that stat-based restoration would miss) gets a test proving the next borrower cannot
see it.
