"""Shared test fixtures — only patterns with multiple real consumers live here.

This module deliberately stays small. A helper earns its place by replacing the same code in
two or more test modules (or a dozen repetitions in one); anything a single module needs stays
in that module, per the repository's proportionality rule. It is named so `unittest discover`
never collects it, and imported as `from tests.support import ...`, which holds under every
sanctioned invocation for the same reason the existing `from scripts import ...` imports do:
the suite runs from the repository root.
