# Decision: the fleet ships to one home-lab operator

**Status:** Accepted 2026-09-02 (operator ruling).

## What was decided

`sde-agents` is a tooling kit for one person who runs a home lab and uses AI coding agents to
help. It is packaged well enough to hand to strangers who run the same kind of lab, but it is not a
platform for a team, and machinery that serves someone developing this repository does not ship
to that operator.

The ruling answers the question the 2026-09-01 scope review left open
(`../archive/2026-08/agent-skill-full-audit-findings-2026-08-30.md` is the complementary defect
audit; the scope review's evidence is the operator's artifact of that date and the harness cuts
that followed it in PRs #168, #169, and #170).

## What it closes, and why

Each of these left `fleet-roadmap.md` on 2026-09-02 on this ruling, not on acceptance evidence.
Their full history is in `../archive/2026-09/roadmap-history-2026-09-01.md`.

- **CTX-002 — met by construction.** The roster the ruling implies (5 agents, 16 model-visible
  skills) measures 6,946 characters of skill descriptions against the 8,000-character host budget,
  with no description edited. The trim the item planned is unnecessary; the doctor's headroom
  check is the closing evidence and runs in the roster change.
- **LEARN-002 — won't-do.** Its thirteen behavioral contracts measure `self-improve-loop`, a
  maintainer skill that leaves the shipped fleet. Paid batches against a skill no operator loads
  are not evidence about the product.
- **HANDOFF-001 — won't-do.** The digest-bound Work Order between `homelab-engineer` and
  `sde-fullstack` had one consumer, its own eval fixture. For one operator, onboarding happens in
  place or is handed to the builder with the plan file. The recurrence that motivated it (issue #60,
  a builder losing onboarding context three times) is answered by not splitting the work across
  two contexts.
- **LADDER-002 — won't-do.** `eng-ladder` routes work between three seniority rungs that one
  operator occupies alone; the roster cut deletes it, so neither repair option is bought and the
  `ladder` routing cluster retires with the skill.

## What lost

Keeping the fleet general enough for a team, with typed handoffs, a learning ledger, and a
seniority ladder, lost to the reader who actually exists. The mechanisms were built well; they had
no consumer.

## What would reopen this

A second regular operator of the same installation, or a measured routing or behavior regression
in the surviving fleet that the removed mechanism demonstrably prevented. Reopening restores the
mechanism from git history with its tests; nothing here is one-way.

## Amendment 2026-09-02

A direct consequence of this ruling, decided the same day: the behavioral evaluation harness
(`scripts/eval_behavioral.py`, `scripts/packet_lint.py`, `evals/behavioral/contracts.json`)
retired. The hooks (`scripts/readonly-guard.py`, `scripts/live-effect-gate.py`) enforce what
matters at runtime; the grader produced most of this year's false-red churn and no shipped role
ran it. EVAL-011 and ORACLE-019 closed won't-do with it — both were entirely about the retired
runner's grading. Every other roadmap item, decision, and doc that promised or cited a behavioral
contract run was amended in the same pass to note the retirement and fall back to routing evals
and the probe.

The first slice of the roster cut landed the same day: `repository-investigator` deleted (the
calling session's own file tools do that work); `onboarding-map` deleted, with `host-onboard` and
`service-onboard` made model-visible so they route from their own descriptions (LANE-001 closed,
met by construction); `self-improve-loop` unshipped — explicit invocation only, out of every
`skills:` preload, and the packet Learning slot removed from every agent along with the validator
checks that pinned it (ACK-001 and LEDGER-001 closed won't-do). `eng-ladder` deleted, with its
four routing positives; the three altitude agents keep the `ladder` cluster's negatives, and the
two craft references that deferred to its principal page now own their own sequencing rule.
