# SDE Agents

A Claude Code plugin for one person who runs a home lab and wants AI agents that behave like a
careful operator: inspect before changing, ask before anything live, roll back before they are
sorry, and write down what they did. It ships agents for running the lab and for writing the
scripts and services that live on it, skills that carry the operating knowledge, and two hooks
that turn "read-only" and "ask first" from promises into controls.

## Fleet

<!-- fleet-inventory:start -->
- **Agents (11):** `application-security-auditor`, `code-reviewer`, `distinguished-architect`, `homelab-engineer`, `multi-agent-architect`, `principal-engineer`, `prompt-engineer`, `repository-investigator`, `researcher`, `sde-fullstack`, `verification-engineer`
- **Skills (20):** `backend-craft`, `ci-actions`, `code-craft`, `eng-ladder`, `frontend-craft`, `host-onboard`, `lab-audit`, `lab-incident`, `observability`, `onboarding-map`, `postmortem`, `prompt-craft`, `restore-drill`, `root-cause`, `runbook`, `security-audit`, `self-improve-loop`, `service-onboard`, `sre-tool`, `upgrade-campaign`
<!-- fleet-inventory:end -->

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add latent-sre/sde-agents
/plugin install sde-agents@latent-sre
```

That installs the agents, the skills, and the two hooks together. Nothing is copied into
`~/.claude`. Components are namespaced by the plugin: `sde-agents:homelab-engineer`,
`/sde-agents:lab-incident`, and so on.

To load the plugin from a checkout instead of the marketplace copy, run `claude --plugin-dir .`
from the repository root.

## What you get

**Running the lab.** `homelab-engineer` is the operator's agent: it classifies every change by
how reversible it is, states the rollback before acting, and hands anything destructive back to
you for a decision. It works the operating skills: `lab-incident` when something is down,
`root-cause` when the fix keeps not sticking, `runbook`, `postmortem`, `restore-drill`,
`upgrade-campaign`, `observability`, and the `lab-audit` and `security-audit` checklists. Bringing
a new machine or a new service into the lab runs `host-onboard` and `service-onboard`.

**Writing what runs on it.** `sde-fullstack` builds scripts, services, and small tools, with
`code-craft` (Bash and PowerShell pitfalls included), `backend-craft`, `frontend-craft`, and
`ci-actions` as its reference shelf. `code-reviewer` reviews a diff read-only. `researcher` is the
only agent with web access, kept away from files that hold your secrets.

**Design and meta.** `principal-engineer` and `distinguished-architect` think through a change
before it is built. `prompt-engineer`, `prompt-craft`, `multi-agent-architect`, and
`self-improve-loop` are for people editing agents and skills, this fleet's included.

Ask in plain language. The right agent or skill fires from its description; you can also name one
directly with its namespaced name.

## How it protects you

Two `PreToolUse` hooks ship with the plugin and register session-wide. Each scopes itself to the
agent making the call and does nothing for anyone else, so your own shell is never inspected.

- **The read-only guard.** `code-reviewer`, `principal-engineer`, `distinguished-architect`, and
  `repository-investigator` hold `Bash` for inspection only. The guard permits an enumerated set
  of read-only commands (`git diff`, `rg`, `cat`, and their kin) and denies everything else,
  including any interpreter. If the guard cannot run, those agents lose Bash rather than gaining
  it.
- **The live-effect gate.** `homelab-engineer` can change your lab, so its control is a question,
  not a denial: every live command it runs (`docker compose up`, `systemctl restart`, `zfs
  destroy`, a reboot) prompts you, and is denied outright in a session that has turned prompts
  off, because a bypassed prompt is not a decision.

Both hooks run from the installed plugin copy, never from a repository under review. Neither is a
sandbox: a reviewer that can read files can read secrets, and the load-bearing control remains the
least privilege you give the session. The wiring, the reasoning, and the honest limits are in
`docs/fleet-development.md`.

## Project context convention

Use the target repository's existing project-instruction file and do not create a competing one.
For a new cross-host repository, prefer a portable root `AGENTS.md`.

Claude Code natively loads `CLAUDE.md` (project, user, and managed levels) and passes it to
subagents automatically; it does **not** read a bare `AGENTS.md`
([memory docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory): "Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, not
`AGENTS.md`"). A repository using portable `AGENTS.md` therefore needs a root `CLAUDE.md` containing
a single `@AGENTS.md` import — on Windows the docs recommend the import over a symlink — or Claude
Code never sees it. Codex consumes `AGENTS.md` directly; Copilot and VS Code adapters are instructed
to honor the active host's project-instruction equivalent. Record the environment card and mission
block in the file the current host actually loads.

This repository follows its own convention: guidance for working on the fleet lives in a portable
root `AGENTS.md`, bridged by a `CLAUDE.md` containing that single import.

Long-running work should use the progress file declared by that project context. When none is
declared, use `.agents/PROGRESS.md` — and in a parallel batch, one shard per builder
(`.agents/progress/<component>.md`), one writer per file, with the orchestrator's plan file
(`.agents/plan.md`) owned by the orchestrator alone. Progress files are coordination state, not a
substitute for the final review packet or committed documentation.

## Other hosts

Claude Code is the primary host. Generated adapters for VS Code and Codex are kept current by the
validator, with the authority each host can actually enforce; the details are in
`docs/fleet-development.md`.

**VS Code.** Open the repository as a workspace folder. The generated `.github/agents/*.agent.md`
profiles and `.github/skills/` are discovered with no install step. Do **not** install the
repository as a VS Code plugin: that path loads the canonical Claude fleet unadapted, including a
hook VS Code cannot scope.

**Codex.**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add latent-sre/sde-agents
codex plugin add sde-agents@latent-sre
python3 scripts/install_codex_agents.py --user
```

The plugin carries the skills; the installer syncs the agent profiles into `~/.codex/agents` and
is the update path for them. On Codex, the onboarding skills are reached by name
(`$service-onboard`), and agents are reached by explicit request rather than routed from their
descriptions.

## Working on the fleet

`AGENTS.md` is the rulebook every editing session loads: what to validate before pushing, the
change playbooks, and the hard rules. `docs/fleet-development.md` holds the long-form material:
which file owns which convention, how the hooks are wired and why, how the fleet is validated and
probed, and how to import from another fleet. `docs/fleet-roadmap.md` is the only task tracker.
After any agent or skill edit, regenerate the host adapters; after adding, renaming, or removing
a component, refresh the inventory above:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_platform_adapters.py --write
python3 scripts/validate_fleet.py --write-inventory
```
