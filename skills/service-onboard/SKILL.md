description: The standardization checklist sde-agents:homelab-platform works when adding a self-hosted service — placement, config-as-code, storage, network, security, monitoring, an operating doc, end-to-end verify. To add or standardize a service, ask sde-agents:homelab-platform (it owns change authority and works this checklist under its tiers); a user can also run it directly as /sde-agents:service-onboard.

The checklist that keeps the lab from rotting. Work through every applicable step in order; mark a
non-applicable step with the predicate that made it unnecessary — silence reads as "done."

`sde-agents:homelab-platform` owns change authority for everything below, and this checklist runs
**under** that agent — it is not self-sufficient standalone. Applicable steps may change config,
storage, networking, and security on a live lab: classify each apply under homelab-platform's tiers
(Tier 0 observe · 1 prepare · 2 reversible live change, needs an authorized decision · 3
destructive/access-path, needs a fresh decision + proven recovery) and use the decision and
transport that owner requires. A disclosed finite Tier 2 plan may share one decision; Tier 3 may
not.
This checklist grants no permission of its own — a step being on the list is not approval to run
it. Whichever way you arrived here (homelab-platform reads it by path, or a user invokes the slash
command), the authority stays with homelab-platform: if you reached it without that agent's tier
discipline, stop and route through it.

**Discovery output is part of the blast radius.** The placement and conflict checks below read
inventories and resolved configuration, and read-only is not capture-safe: a broad variable or
inventory dump can expand decrypted secrets (exporter credentials, backup keys, bind passwords,
break-glass material) into operator-visible output and from there into packets and evidence.
Query the specific fields a step needs, redact resolved secret values, and never paste a resolved
variable map into output — field-proven during a real onboarding, not hypothetical.

**Read the lab's own profile before step 1.** The lab repo's project context should state the stack, hosts, conventions, and quirks; those facts outrank any default in this checklist, and proposing something the lab's profile rules out wastes a round. If the lab has no such file, [`assets/lab-profile.template.md`](assets/lab-profile.template.md) is the shape to create in *the lab's* repository (not in this plugin — the plugin ships method, the lab owns its facts).

## Applicability predicates

Classify these once before step 1. They add controls to the small universal floor; a false predicate
removes its dependent work rather than demanding an exception packet.

- **Irreplaceable persistent data** — loss would matter and the state cannot be recreated from a
  declared source. Requires backup inclusion, a named restore path, and restore evidence. Ephemeral
  or deliberately disposable state records its loss tolerance instead.
- **Trust-boundary exposure** — users or callers cross from a less-trusted network or identity
  boundary. Requires the lab's proxy/TLS/auth pattern and a probe through that real boundary.
- **Household-critical** — someone would notice the service being down or recovery cannot wait for
  the next maintenance window. Requires actionable alerting, recovery documentation, and restart
  recovery evidence.
- **Privilege or resource contention** — the service needs elevated/device access or shares scarce
  CPU, memory, disk, or I/O. Requires least-privilege isolation, limits where the platform supports
  them, and capacity visibility.

Every service still gets version-pinned source configuration, deliberate restart behavior, one
useful health signal, rollback, and an end-to-end check.

1. **Placement** — which host, what resource envelope (CPU/RAM/disk), and what conflicts exist (ports, storage paths, names). A host that is itself new to the lab first works `sde-agents:host-onboard`; this checklist assumes the machine under it is already a lab citizen.
2. **Config as code** — compose file or unit in the lab repo; image version pinned (never `latest`);
   deliberate restart behavior; one health signal. Add hard resource limits only when privilege or
   contention makes them protective; otherwise the stated resource envelope is enough.
3. **Storage** — declare the state as none, ephemeral, recreatable, or irreplaceable. Use named
   volumes or explicit paths where state exists. Only irreplaceable state joins the backup set and
   owes an existing restore path; record the loss tolerance for everything else.
4. **Network** — bind to the smallest consumer network or loopback. Add reverse proxy, DNS, TLS,
   and an external-path probe when the service crosses a trust boundary. Direct exposure beyond
   the declared consumer boundary needs written justification.
5. **Security** — remove or change default credentials always. Add SSO, basic auth, or app-native
   auth when exposure or data sensitivity requires an identity boundary. Privileged/device access
   gets the narrowest identity, device grant, and isolation that still works.
6. **Observability** — provide one useful health signal: an existing container health check,
   service status, or external probe may be enough. Household-critical services get an actionable
   alert. Add metrics or a dashboard only for a named operational question. Query, threshold, and
   dashboard design belongs to `sde-agents:observability`.
7. **Operating record** — inventory the lab repository for an existing canonical runbook and owner.
   Work `sde-agents:runbook` to update one you relied on or create one when the service is
   household-critical, recovery is non-obvious, or an operation will recur. Otherwise an inventory
   entry with health, rollback, and owner is enough. Persist all four predicate outcomes in either
   record, with the supporting operator facts: state class and loss tolerance, trust boundary and
   exposure, household criticality and recovery expectation, and privilege or resource contention.
   Record a false predicate as `not applicable` with its supporting fact; do not leave it implicit.
   If a required runbook cannot yet be created, propose the exact gap using that skill's closed
   grammar. A runbook grants no execution authority.
8. **End-to-end verify** — within the approved change tier, exercise the final URL or real consumer
   path and observe the chosen health signal. Restart once and prove automatic recovery only for a
   household-critical service or custom lifecycle; initial startup plus the end-to-end check is
   enough for a routine disposable service. Bind evidence to the deployed version and config
   identity. Mark blocked checks `unverified` with an owner rather than claiming completion.

Finish with the review packet: what was deployed; which four predicates fired or did not; the
service rollback (how to remove it cleanly); the operating-record disposition and canonical path;
the version/config identity tested; exact evidence from step 8; and every item you could not verify,
kept distinct from the ones that did not apply —
each unverified item naming its owner: the operator by default, or the specific person or system
that must resolve it. The owner is a durable name, never the emitting session — the packet's
reader is a later session that cannot tell a self-owned gap from an unassigned one, and that is
how a verification gets silently lost. The unverified items are the load-bearing part: they are
what stops a partly applied checklist from reading as a finished one. A full template with
unverified headings is not completion evidence.
