# Database reliability — migrations, slow queries, and restores

Read this before a schema migration on a live database, when a query is slow, when connections or
locks are contended, or when designing backups. Write-side transaction mechanics live in
[`persistence.md`](persistence.md); this file owns operating a database that already has data in it.

The universal backend rules live in `skills/backend-craft/SKILL.md`. On any conflict, SKILL.md wins.

## `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the statement

This is the single most expensive misunderstanding in database work. `EXPLAIN` plans;
**`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` runs it** — including `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT`.

| Statement | `EXPLAIN` | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` |
|---|---|---|
| `SELECT` | plans only | runs it (reads only) |
| `UPDATE` / `DELETE` / `INSERT` | plans only | **performs the write** |

The safe recipe, every time, on anything that isn't a plain `SELECT`:

```sql
BEGIN;
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) UPDATE orders SET status = 'x' WHERE id = 42;
ROLLBACK;   -- the write is undone; the timings are real
```

Two caveats that surprise people even with the rollback: **sequences do not roll back** (a
`nextval()` consumed inside the transaction stays consumed), and **foreign data wrappers / triggers
that reach outside the database** may have already acted. Neither is reversible by `ROLLBACK`.

## Migrations on a live database

- **A migration that cannot stop the readers is expand → migrate → contract**, and each phase ships
  separately: add the new nullable column or table, backfill and dual-write, then remove the old
  form once nothing reads it. What earns the three phases is old and new code running at the same
  time — a rolling deploy, a second consumer, a client you cannot restart. A single service you can
  stop for twenty seconds can take the brief downtime and migrate in one step; paying for a
  dual-write window to avoid a restart nobody would notice is the expensive way to do it. The
  sequencing at design altitude is owned by `sde-agents:eng-ladder`'s principal reference; this is
  the database mechanics.
- **A `NOT NULL` column added with a default rewrites the table** on older engines and takes an
  exclusive lock for the duration. The lock-light path in Postgres:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c text;                        -- fast, nullable
  -- backfill in batches, committing between them
  ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT c_not_null CHECK (c IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;  -- no scan, enforced for new rows
  ALTER TABLE t VALIDATE CONSTRAINT c_not_null;           -- scans without blocking writes
  ```

- **Backfill in bounded batches with a commit between them.** One `UPDATE` over ten million rows
  holds locks and bloats the write-ahead log until it finishes or the disk fills. A batch loop with a
  sleep is slower and safe to interrupt.
- **`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`** (and `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY`): slower, no write lock. It cannot
  run inside a transaction, and it can leave an **invalid** index behind if it fails — check for that
  and drop it before retrying, or the next attempt fails confusingly.
- **Set a lock timeout for DDL** (`SET lock_timeout = '5s'`) so a migration that can't get its lock
  fails fast instead of queueing behind a long read — and queueing *ahead of* every subsequent query,
  which is how one `ALTER TABLE` stops the whole service.
- **A migration is not deployed until it is reversible or proven forward-only.** Write the down path,
  or state explicitly that there isn't one and why that's acceptable.
- **Never let the ORM auto-migrate in production.** Generate the SQL, read it, commit it, run it
  deliberately.

## Slow queries

Work in this order — it is roughly cheapest-first:

1. **Read the plan** (`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, safely as above). Look for a sequential scan on a
   large table, a nested loop over many rows, and a **row-estimate that is wildly off** from actual —
   bad estimates mean stale statistics (`ANALYZE`) and the planner is choosing on bad information.
2. **Index the predicate, not the table.** Composite index column order follows the query's equality
   columns first, then the range/sort column. An index the planner won't use is often a type mismatch
   or a function applied to the column (`WHERE lower(email) = …` needs an expression index).
3. **Fix N+1 at the application**, not with a bigger machine — one query per row in a loop is the most
   common cause of "the database is slow".
4. **Bound every result set.** Pagination is a reliability control, not a UX nicety
   (`sde-agents:backend-craft` requires it from day one).
5. Only then consider caching, denormalization, or hardware — each adds a new failure mode.

Watch for the index that costs more than it saves: every index slows writes and consumes space, and an
unused index is pure overhead (`pg_stat_user_indexes` shows which are never scanned).

## Connections, locks, and saturation

- **Connections are a bounded resource; use a pool** sized deliberately (a small pool plus queueing
  beats a huge pool that overwhelms the database). A serverless or per-request connection pattern
  exhausts the server's limit under load, and the symptom is failures on the *healthy* requests.
- **Long-running transactions are the hidden cause of most Postgres trouble**: they block DDL, hold
  locks, and prevent vacuum from reclaiming dead rows, so bloat grows and everything slows. Keep
  transactions short; never hold one open across a network call to another service or a user prompt.
- **Deadlocks** come from inconsistent lock ordering. Acquire locks in the same order everywhere, keep
  transactions short, and retry the loser with backoff — a deadlock is expected under concurrency, not
  a bug in itself.
- **Idle-in-transaction is worse than idle.** Alert on it (`sde-agents:observability`).
- Triage during an incident is `sde-agents:lab-incident`'s mitigate-first path — kill the runaway
  query to restore service, then come back here for the cause.

## Backups and restores

- **RPO and RTO are decisions, and both are numbers**: how much data you can lose (drives backup
  frequency and whether you need WAL archiving / point-in-time recovery) and how long recovery may
  take (drives the method). Write them down; an unstated RPO is "however often the cron happens to
  run".
- **An untested backup is not a backup.** Restore into a scratch instance on a schedule and *query
  the result* — verifying the dump file exists proves only that a file exists. Record the date and
  the measured duration in the service's runbook Recovery slot (`sde-agents:runbook`), so the RTO is
  observed rather than assumed. `sde-agents:restore-drill` runs this as a rehearsal.
- **Logical dumps** (`pg_dump`) are portable and slow to restore; **physical/PITR** is fast and
  version-bound. Most home labs want nightly logical dumps plus, for anything whose loss would hurt,
  WAL archiving.
- **A restore over a non-empty database fails** — plan the drop/recreate, and put the exact commands
  in the runbook rather than deriving them under pressure.
- Test the restore **after a major version upgrade**, because that's exactly when a physical backup
  stops being restorable.
- Encrypt backups at rest, keep one copy off the box, and verify the copy is readable — a backup on
  the same disk as the database is a copy, not a backup.
