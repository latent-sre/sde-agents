name: observability
description: Designs the monitoring that makes a system answerable — metrics, logs, traces, alerts that page on symptoms, dashboards, and collection pipelines. Use when instrumenting a service, writing or fixing a PromQL/LogQL query, designing an alert or SLO burn-rate rule, building a Grafana dashboard, or deciding what to collect. Applying any of it to the live lab routes through sde-agents:homelab-platform's change tiers. Not for responding to a live outage (sde-agents:lab-incident) and not for the fleet's own routing evals.

# Observability

Monitoring exists to answer one question at 3 a.m.: **is this broken, and where?** Everything below
serves that. A dashboard nobody reads during an incident and an alert nobody can act on are both
cost without coverage.

Three fleet components *demand* monitoring — `sde-agents:homelab-platform` (Prime directives),
`sde-agents:service-onboard` (step 6), `sde-agents:lab-audit` (findings) — and this skill is where
the how lives. The lab's stack is Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alloy; the rules are
stack-neutral, and those are the worked examples.

**Applies are not yours.** Writing a rule file, dashboard JSON, or scrape config is authoring;
reloading Prometheus, importing to Grafana, or restarting Alloy is an apply under
`sde-agents:homelab-platform`'s tiers. Hand it over with the exact command and the rollback.

## Instrument for the questions you'll ask

- **RED for request-driven work** (rate, errors, duration) and **USE for resources** (utilization,
  saturation, errors). Between them they answer "is it serving?" and "is it running out?".
- **Cardinality is the budget.** A label whose values are unbounded — user id, request id, path with
  ids in it, container id — multiplies series until the database is the outage. Bounded labels only
  (service, route *template*, method, status class, host). One high-cardinality label added
  thoughtlessly is the most common self-inflicted monitoring failure.
- **Names carry units and stay stable**: `http_request_duration_seconds`, `queue_depth`,
  `backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds`. Seconds and bytes, never milliseconds and megabytes.
- **Histograms for latency, never averages.** An average hides the tail that users feel; p99 is the
  number that corresponds to somebody's bad experience.
- **The most valuable metric in a home lab is a timestamp**: `*_last_success_timestamp_seconds` for
  every backup, sync, and scheduled job. Alerting on "hasn't succeeded in N hours" catches the
  silent failures that no error rate ever shows, because a job that never ran emits no errors.
- Every service exposes `/healthz` and `/readyz` distinctly (see `sde-agents:backend-craft`) and a
  metrics endpoint the scraper can reach.

## Logs

- **Structured, one event per line**, with the request id that `sde-agents:backend-craft` requires
  on every entry — that id is what makes a user report greppable across services.
- Log at boundaries and decisions, not inside loops. A log line per iteration is how you fill a disk
  and cause the next outage.
- **Never log secrets, tokens, or personal data** — logs are the least-protected copy of your data,
  and they get shipped, indexed, and shared in screenshots.
- Keep labels/streams low-cardinality for the same reason as metrics; put the varying detail in the
  message body, not in the stream identity.
- Retention is a decision, not a default: how far back you can look, and what it costs on disk.

## Alerts — page on symptoms, not causes

- **Alert on what a user would notice**: the site is erroring, the page is slow, the backup hasn't
  succeeded, the certificate expires in days. Not on CPU being high — CPU being high while
  everything works is not an incident.
- **Every alert answers three things**: what's broken, how bad, what to do. That third one is a link
  to the service's runbook (`sde-agents:runbook`), so the alert and the recovery path are the same
  artifact.
- **If an alert isn't actionable, delete it.** Alert fatigue is not a discipline problem; it is a
  design defect, and the fix is fewer alerts, not more willpower.
- **Symptom alerts page; cause alerts inform.** Saturation and capacity trends belong on a
  dashboard or a daily digest, not on a pager at 3 a.m.
- Alerts need `for:` durations long enough to survive a scrape blip, and thresholds you can defend.
  A threshold nobody can explain gets silenced the first time it's noisy, and then it's decoration.
- **Household scale, honestly**: multi-window burn-rate SLO machinery is designed for services with
  a paging rotation. In a one-operator lab, "the thing is down" plus "the backup is stale" plus
  "the certificate expires soon" covers most real risk. Reach for burn-rate rules when a service
  genuinely has a target you're managing to, not because the pattern exists.

## Dashboards

- **One dashboard per service, answering the incident questions in reading order**: is it up, is it
  erroring, is it slow, is it saturated. A dashboard that requires knowing where to look has failed
  its purpose.
- Overview at the top (a few big numbers), detail below. Time range and interval as variables so
  the same panel works at 5 minutes and 7 days.
- **Dashboards as code**, provisioned from the repo — a dashboard edited only in the UI is lost with
  the container and cannot be reviewed.
- Label every axis with its unit, and set thresholds where the color means something specific.
- A panel per *question*, not per available metric. The temptation is to plot everything the
  exporter offers; that dashboard is unreadable exactly when it matters.

## Verify it before calling it done

An alert that has never fired and a dashboard that has never been read during a real problem are
both unverified. Before "done":

- The query returns what you expect against **real data** — paste the query and its result.
- The alert rule **fires** when you force its condition (a deliberately failing check, a test rule
  with an always-true expression, or `promtool test rules` for the arithmetic) and resolves after.
  A rule that only ever evaluated to zero is written, not verified.
- Reloads were validated first: `promtool check rules` / `promtool check config`, `alloy fmt`, the
  dashboard JSON imports cleanly.
- The runbook link in the alert resolves to a runbook that exists.

## Before you write it — load the reference for what you're building

| If the task involves… | Read first |
|---|---|
| a PromQL query, a recording rule, or metric math | [`references/promql.md`](references/promql.md) |
| a LogQL query, log-derived metrics, or Loki labels | [`references/logql.md`](references/logql.md) |
| an alert rule, thresholds, routing, or SLO burn rates | [`references/alerting.md`](references/alerting.md) |
| a Grafana dashboard, panels, or provisioning | [`references/dashboards.md`](references/dashboards.md) |
| collection — scrape configs, Alloy/OTel pipelines, exporters | [`references/pipeline.md`](references/pipeline.md) |

Computing an error budget from a target and an observed success rate?
[`scripts/error_budget.py`](scripts/error_budget.py) does the arithmetic (pure stdlib, no network).

Trips two predicates? Read both. Trips none? The core above is the whole job.

The **review packet** is the end-of-task report defined by the calling agent. Invoked standalone
with no packet convention in context, end with: Changed / Assumptions / Verified / Not verified —
and label load-bearing claims `[verified]`, `[sourced]`, or `[unverified]`.
