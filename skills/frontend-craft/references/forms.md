# Forms

Read this when the view collects user input for submission.

The universal frontend rules live in `skills/frontend-craft/SKILL.md`. On any conflict, SKILL.md wins.

- Use the repository's established form state and validation path. For a small form, framework
  primitives may be enough; introduce a form library only when repeated field arrays, cross-field
  rules, or multi-step state justify it. Validate on blur and submit, never only on submit.
  Framework-specific binding follows the applicable React/Vue component contract and the
  repository's established form stack.
- **The server is the source of validation truth** — mirror obvious rules client-side for speed, but always map the server's field errors back to the offending fields inline.
- **Dirty tracking**: Save disabled until something changed; warn before leaving unsaved edits (route guard + `beforeunload`). Never make the user retype after an error.
- **Label and error wiring is accessibility wiring.** Every control is programmatically labeled — `<label for>`/`id` association (`htmlFor` in JSX) or the repo's field component that renders it; visible text near an input is not a label until associated. Error text links to its field via `aria-describedby` plus `aria-invalid` and announces (`role="alert"`), so what the sighted user sees inline, the screen-reader user hears.
- **Required** is conveyed to assistive tech (`required`/`aria-required`), never by an asterisk alone — the asterisk itself is `aria-hidden`. Identity and credential fields carry `autocomplete` (`email`, `current-password`, …) — autofill is usability and accessibility at once.
