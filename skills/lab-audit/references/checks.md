# Lab-audit checks — command-level detail

Read from `SKILL.md`. Every command here is read-only; anything that would fix what it finds
routes to `sde-agents:homelab-engineer`. Substitute the lab's real hosts, paths, and domains, and
read the lab repo's own config first — every drift-style check is a comparison against intended
state, and the repo is where intended state lives.

Per check: what to read, what a finding looks like, and the fix class (one line — the audit never
applies it).

## 1. Exposure

Hygiene depth only: listening sockets vs the proxy list. The adversary's version of this question —
what a specific attacker position reaches, and across which boundary — is
`sde-agents:security-audit`'s [`references/checks.md`](../../security-audit/references/checks.md)
row 1; a finding here that needs an attack path belongs there.

- Read: `ss -tlnp` per Linux host (`netstat -ano` on a Windows host); the reverse-proxy config
  from the lab repo; the router/firewall forward table where the repo exports it.
- Compare: every listening socket vs what the proxy fronts; anything bound to `0.0.0.0`/`[::]`
  that is not the proxy or a deliberate LAN service; WAN-reachable ports vs the declared forward
  list; anything answering without auth in front.
- Finding: `[P0]` WAN-reachable without auth; `[P1]` LAN-wide listener bypassing the proxy.
- Fix class: front it with the proxy + auth, close the port, or justify the exception in writing.

## 2. Container hygiene

- Read: `docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}'`; `docker inspect <name>` for
  restart policy, healthcheck, and limits; `docker compose config` rendered from the repo file.
- Finding: `:latest` or untagged images; restart behavior is undeclared; no useful health signal;
  exited or restart-looping containers; privileged or resource-contentious workloads have no
  isolation or limits.
- Fix class: pin the tag; declare restart behavior; add the smallest useful health signal; add
  isolation or limits where its predicate fires — Tier 1 edit, Tier 2 apply.

## 3. Certificates

- Read: `openssl x509 -in <cert> -noout -enddate -subject` for every cert path the proxy config
  names. Live-endpoint probes (`openssl s_client`, curl) are network calls — when the session
  can't run them, the row lands in the denominator, not in silence.
- Finding: `[P1]` expiry ≤30 days with no renewal evidence (timer, cron, recent renewal log); a
  service crossing a trust boundary still uses plain HTTP with nothing in front.
- Fix class: repair the renewal path, or move the service behind the proxy.

## 4. Backups

- Read: the backup tool's config and its last-run state or log; the irreplaceable-state set (every
  service whose data matters and cannot be recreated from a declared source); documented loss
  tolerances; runbook Recovery slots and Last-verified lines where those runbooks are required.
- Finding: `[P0]` irreplaceable state absent from the backup set; last success older than the
  service's cadence; required restore never tested — a backup that has never been restored is a
  hope, not a backup (the rehearsal routes to `sde-agents:restore-drill`). Recreatable or explicitly
  disposable state is not a backup finding when its loss tolerance is recorded.
- Fix class: add to the backup set; schedule the restore drill.

## 5. Monitoring gaps

- Read: scrape/probe target lists and alert rules from the monitoring config in the repo; the
  receiver/route config those alerts point at. Live API queries land in the denominator when the
  session can't make them; config-vs-config answers most of this check.
- Finding: no useful health signal for an operated service; a household-critical service has no
  actionable alert; an alert routes to a receiver that no longer exists; a rule targets a service
  that's gone. Missing per-service metrics or a dashboard is not itself a finding without a named
  question they were supposed to answer.
- Fix class: add the smallest signal or fix the route — `sde-agents:observability` designs it,
  `sde-agents:homelab-engineer` applies it.

## 6. Drift

- Read: `docker compose config` (rendered intent) vs `docker inspect` of what runs — image, mounts,
  ports, env-file names (names, never values); `git -C <lab-repo> status --short` plus recent log
  for the config dirs.
- Finding: a running container that differs from the repo's rendering; console changes never
  reconciled back to code.
- Fix class: reconcile the repo (Tier 1), then re-apply from code (Tier 2).

## 7. Capacity

- Read: `df -h` (flag >80%); `du -sh` on the known growers (media, logs, backups);
  `docker system df`; growth rate = compare against the previous audit's ledger row.
- Finding: >80% and growing; a log or volume growing with no rotation (no logrotate conf, no
  logging-driver max-size).
- Fix class: rotation or retention policy, or a storage plan — never a mid-audit prune.

## 8. Updates

- Read: pinned versions from the repo, prioritizing the security-relevant surface — the proxy,
  VPN, and anything check 1 shows exposed. Upstream-latest intel is a web lookup; when the
  session can't fetch it, say so in the denominator (the caller or `sde-agents:researcher`
  supplies it).
- Finding: an exposed service far behind upstream, or a pinned image with a known-exploited CVE
  when version intel is available. Bare `:latest` belongs to check 2, not here.
- Fix class: a planned bump — one service via `sde-agents:homelab-engineer`; a batch via
  `sde-agents:upgrade-campaign`.

## Findings ledger (output convention)

The audit's final block, emitted after the top-three. One row per finding, append-ready for the
lab repo's audit ledger (e.g. `audits/ledger.md` — the operator's location wins). This skill runs
without write tools, so **emitting the block is how the ledger gets written** — by the operator or
the agent they hand it to.

| date | check | sev | finding (one line) | evidence (cmd) | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-27 | backups | P0 | wiki-db volume not in backup set | `restic snapshots` empty for path | open |

`status` is `open` when emitted; the ledger's keeper flips it to `fixed` or `accepted`. An
`accepted` row carries or points at its written justification — the exception check 1 asks for in
writing — because the reader of that row is the next audit session, which otherwise cannot tell a
considered exception from a silence. A finding re-observed next audit updates its existing row
rather than adding a twin — the ledger reads as current state; git history is the history.
