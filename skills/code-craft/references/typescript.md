# TypeScript — idioms and the traps that pass review

Read before writing TypeScript or JavaScript in any framework. The universal rules live in
`skills/code-craft/SKILL.md`. On any conflict, SKILL.md wins; the repository's own conventions
outrank both. Layer boundary: `sde-agents:frontend-craft` owns the UI layer — state placement
across the app, resilience UX, accessibility. This file owns what the code does inside a module or
component.

## Make the compiler catch what review would miss

- **Brand your ids.** `type UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' }` costs nothing at
  runtime and stops an order id crossing into a user-id slot at check time. Two ids of the same
  primitive type in one signature is the bug the checker can't see until you brand them.
- **Variants are a discriminated union**, not a string field plus `if`s:
  `type State = { status: 'success'; data: T } | { status: 'error'; error: E }` — narrow with a
  `switch` on the discriminant, and give the `default` branch a `never` assignment so adding a
  variant fails compilation everywhere it isn't handled.
- **Separate input types from output types.** What callers send (`CreateTaskInput`) and what you
  return (`Task`, with server-owned id and timestamps) drift independently; one shared type grows
  optional fields that lie in both directions.

## The traps that produce wrong behavior, not errors

- **A floating promise swallows its rejection.** An `async` call without `await` fails silently —
  enable the lint rule (`no-floating-promises`) and treat every exception it flags as a decision to
  justify. `void` only discards the promise; it observes nothing, so fire-and-forget still needs a
  `.catch` that reports to your error boundary. `void someCall()` with a comment is a silenced
  lint, not a handled failure.
- **Sequential awaits on independent work** is the number-one performance defect class: three
  `await`s in a row are three round trips; `Promise.all` makes them one. Waterfalls compound in
  server components and route handlers where every render pays them.
- **Don't await before the branch that needs it.** A fetch above an early return blocks the path
  that never uses the result — move each `await` into the branch that consumes it, cheapest guard
  first.
- **Module scope on a server is process-wide shared memory.** Concurrent renders and requests
  share it: a `let currentUser` written by one request and read by another leaks one user's data
  into another's response. Request data travels through props and arguments; module scope is for
  immutable config and deliberately shared, correctly keyed caches.
- **Barrel imports load the whole library.** A package's `index` entry can re-export thousands of
  modules, and tree-shaking often fails to rescue an external dependency — it depends on the
  package's module format and side-effect declarations, which you don't control. Import deep from
  the module you use, or turn on the framework's import optimizer; deep paths in some libraries
  ship no `.d.ts` and go implicit-`any` under `strict` — check before committing to that form.

## Framework boundary

React and Vue rendering, state, lifecycle, SSR, and component-composition rules live in
`sde-agents:frontend-craft`'s conditional framework references. This language reference still
applies inside their `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `<script lang="ts">` code, but JSX/TSX or the word
"component" alone does not identify a framework.

## The write path (any app with a query/cache layer)

- **The optimistic lifecycle is five beats, in order**: cancel in-flight queries → snapshot every
  affected cache → patch instantly → on error, restore the exact snapshot → on settle (success
  *and* error), invalidate so server-computed fields refetch. Skipping cancel is the classic
  flicker: an already-in-flight refetch resolves after your patch and clobbers it. Rollback
  restores the snapshot verbatim, never a re-derivation.
- **Know when not to be optimistic**: a create returning server-owned fields runs as a pending
  mutation that seeds the cache from the response; a destructive or money-moving write confirms
  first; and server state lives in the query cache only — never mirrored into a client store.
- **One entity lives in many caches** — its detail plus every filtered list page. Patch and
  snapshot all of them through a hierarchical query-key factory, or the badge in the list
  disagrees with the detail view after the write.
- **Mint the idempotency key once per logical write** — at first intent (form init or the click
  that starts the operation) — and thread that same key through every retry of it. A key generated
  inside the mutation function regenerates per retry and protects nothing: that is the
  double-charge bug. Rotate it after the write settles, or an "add another" flow on a still-mounted
  form replays the first key and gets the recorded response instead of a second write. Pair it with
  disabled-while-pending so a user can't fire a second distinct write.
- **Retries are stratified by safety**: reads retry with backoff; a non-idempotent write
  auto-retries only when the same server-enforced idempotency key rides along, and never on 4xx. A
  bare network error is ambiguous — the server may have committed before the connection dropped —
  so without a key, a "pure network error" retry is a duplicate charge. A `409` never auto-retries:
  surface the conflict, invalidate, and let the user decide on fresh data.

## Verify

Before "done": the typechecker at the repo's configured strictness and the linter are clean
(`no-floating-promises` on), tests pass per [tdd.md](tdd.md), and anything rendered was
exercised in a real browser — that gate, and where state should live at all, belong to
`sde-agents:frontend-craft`.
