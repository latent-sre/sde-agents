"""Clean-room support for model-driven plugin evals.

`claude -p` normally inherits personal agents, skills, plugins, settings, and CLAUDE.md. That makes
an eval describe the operator's machine rather than the plugin under test. This module relocates the
Claude configuration to a temporary directory containing only authentication material and refuses
to turn runner/auth failures into routing outcomes.

Adapted from latent-sre/sre-agents' clean-room design, with a Python 3.10-compatible cleanup path.
