    # so. Warnings are distinct from failures rather than promoted into them: 1 still means a check
    # FAILED, 3 means no check failed but at least one warning needs attention (host drift is the
    # common cause, not the only one — CRLF paths and listing-budget overruns warn too; an absent
    # host CLI is a skip, not a warning), and only 0 means nothing needs attention.
    # A per-check `inconclusive` reached no exit status at all, so a check the doctor could not
    # compute exited 0 — the doctor agreeing that everything is fine on the strength of an answer
    # it never obtained (DOCTOR-002). That is the same defect as the warnings one above, one level
    # down: the report said so on stdout and nothing a caller can branch on did.

    # a check that FAILED is a definite negative and the most actionable thing here; then 2, where
    # nothing failed but the no-failures claim rests on checks that did not all run; then 3 for
    # warnings, where everything computed. A skip is not in the ladder — an absent host CLI is a
