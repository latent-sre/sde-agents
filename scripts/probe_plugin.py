"""Behavioral probe — prove the plugin LOADS and the guard actually GUARDS.

`validate_fleet.py` and `claude plugin validate` both check files. Neither can tell you that the
fleet loads, that `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expands where the agents depend on it, or that the
read-only guard fires for the reviewer and only for the reviewer. Those are runtime facts, and this
fleet's guard rests on `agent_type` — documented upstream, with the contract owned by the
readonly-guard.py docstring. Documentation is a promise about the contract, not proof the binary
you just pinned still honors it: this probe is the only thing standing between a silent upstream
rename and a quietly disarmed guard.

Re-run after upgrading the Claude Code CLI.

It also proves that `skills:` preloading actually fires for a plugin-shipped agent — an undocumented
guarantee this fleet now depends on — and that ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} still expands for the one skill
that cannot be preloaded (service-onboard, which is model-invocation-disabled).

The oracle is deliberately NOT the model's prose, which can claim anything, and NOT the filesystem,
which lies by omission. Two earlier designs failed here and both failures are instructive:

  * "the reviewer's `touch` created no file, so the guard blocked it" — WRONG. The reviewer read its
    own inspection-only mandate and declined the command before the hook ever ran. No file, no
    guard, and a green check. A missing file proves nothing about who prevented it.
  * "the main loop's `touch` created no file, so the guard wrongly caught it" — also WRONG. Claude
    Code's own sandbox refused the write. Not this guard at all.

So the oracle is each command's OWN tool_result, correlated by `tool_use_id`, and the commands are
chosen so the agent will actually attempt them: `find -exec` is an idiomatic read-only search that a
reviewer runs in good faith, and which this guard denies precisely because `-exec` can run anything.
That tests the guard rather than the agent's willingness. Nothing is written to disk, so Claude
Code's write sandbox cannot interfere with the verdict.

A refusal by Claude Code's own permission layer is not this guard doing its job and is never scored
as one: those are reported INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2), never PASS.
