"""PreToolUse guard — enforce read-only agents at the command level, by ALLOWLIST.

Shipped by the sde-agents PLUGIN and registered through `hooks/hooks.json`, which Claude Code
installs as a SESSION-WIDE PreToolUse hook. It therefore has to scope ITSELF: it no-ops unless the
calling agent is in GUARDED_AGENTS.

Why it cannot simply live on the agent, as it used to: a plugin-shipped agent's `hooks:` frontmatter
is SILENTLY IGNORED ("For security reasons, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` are not
supported for plugin-shipped agents" — code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference). Probed on CLI
2.1.200: a plugin agent's frontmatter hook never fired, while a byte-identical hook on a
project-scope agent did. Leaving `hooks:` on the agent would read as armor and provide none, so
validate_fleet.py now rejects that key outright.

Nor can the `tools:` field do this job. A scoped grant like `tools: Bash(git diff:*)` LOOKS like it
narrows Bash, and does nothing: probed on CLI 2.1.200, agents granted `Bash(git diff:*)` and
`Bash(git diff *)` both ran `git status` exactly like an agent granted a bare `Bash`. Scoped
specifiers are real, but only in settings.json permission rules — which are session-wide and would
restrict the USER's Bash too. There is no native per-agent command scoping. This hook is not a
workaround for a better mechanism; it is the only mechanism.

ALLOWLIST, NOT DENYLIST — the load-bearing design decision.

  This guard used to enumerate the state-changing verbs and deny them. That is an unbounded problem
  and it lost: `git clone`, `git submodule update`, `git lfs pull`, `npm ci`, `uv sync`,
  `gh api -f` (which POSTs) and `curl --json` all sailed through, while `rg "gh pr create" docs/` —
  a harmless search whose TEXT contained a verb — was denied. Every new tool ships new ways to
  write, so a denylist is permanently behind, and its failure mode is SILENT: an unlisted writer
  simply runs.

  So it is inverted. We enumerate what a read-only reviewer actually NEEDS — a bounded, knowable
  set — and deny everything else. Failure now means a legitimate read gets blocked: loud, obvious,
  and fixed by adding one entry. That is the right direction to fail in.

  It also means the guard no longer has to out-parse a hostile shell. Anything it cannot confidently
  understand — command substitution, redirection, a subshell, an unbalanced quote — is simply not on
  the list, and is denied.

NO CODE EXECUTION, DELIBERATELY. There is no `python`, `pytest`, `npm`, or `make` on the allowlist,
and no exemption for any script — not even this repository's own validator. Running a repo's test
suite executes that repo's code under your account; no command filter can make that read-only, and
pretending otherwise is the dishonest part. A reviewer cites the builder's test evidence or CI
instead. This also dissolves, rather than fixes, the old relative-path exemption for
`scripts/validate_fleet.py`, which a repository under review could have supplied itself.

Honest boundary — this is still NOT a sandbox. An allowlisted command with a flag combination we
did not consider may yet do something surprising, and a reviewer that can read files can read
secrets. The LOAD-BEARING control remains OS-level least privilege. What this now guarantees is far
narrower and far more defensible than before: nothing outside a short, reviewed list of readers ever
runs.

GIT IS AN INTERPRETER WHEN ITS CONFIG SAYS SO — the one hole no flag list can close. Probed on git
2.43: with `diff.<driver>.command` (or `.textconv`) in a repo's LOCAL `.git/config` and a
`.gitattributes` line selecting that driver, a BARE `git diff` — no flags at all — executes the
named program. So `--ext-diff`/`--textconv` are deliberately NOT denied here: denying them would
close nothing while reading as armor, which is the failure mode this file exists to avoid. The
mitigating fact is that the vector needs local config: `git clone` does not carry the remote's
config, so a hostile repo you cloned yourself cannot set the driver, and `.gitattributes` alone
falls back to git's internal diff. It bites when a repo ARRIVES as a directory or archive
(mounted volume, tarball, handover) with its `.git/config` already written. Treat "review a repo
directory you did not clone" as running its code, and let OS-level least privilege — not this
guard — be what holds. (`core.pager` is NOT part of this: probed on the same version, git skips
the pager entirely when stdout is not a TTY, which it never is under a hook.)
Two same-family residuals, reviewer-reproduced on the same version. First, `git status` executes
a `core.fsmonitor` command from that same LOCAL config — which is why the investigator's arrival
boundary withholds ALL git commands, not merely history commands, until provenance is stated
(the prose is the fix; this docstring owns the statement of why). Second, in a partial clone an
allowlisted `git show <old>:<path>` lazily fetches missing promisor objects from the repo's own
configured remote — an outbound fetch inside the investigator's no-network slice. Hash-verified,
so a tampering remote cannot inject content, but a real hole in the literal claim;
`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` would close it if this guard ever gains an env channel, and until then the
no-network claim is qualified here rather than overstated.

SCOPING CONTRACT (probed, not assumed): the stdin payload carries `agent_type` — namespaced for a
plugin agent (`sde-agents:code-reviewer`), bare for a project/user-scope one. A PLAIN main loop
carries no `agent_type` key, which is what makes a session-wide hook safe: the user's own Bash in
an ordinary session never matches GUARDED_AGENTS and is never inspected. A session launched with
`--agent` does carry that agent's name (inside a subagent, the subagent's type takes precedence),
so a main session deliberately run as a guarded agent is guarded on purpose, not as collateral —
this `--agent` clause is doc-sourced, not probe-verified: the probe drives subagent spawns only
(extending it is PROBE-001 in docs/fleet-roadmap.md).
The field and its plugin-scoped values are documented in the upstream hooks reference
(code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md); this docstring owns the fleet's statement of the contract —
other files point here rather than restating it. Documentation is not proof a newly pinned binary
still honors the contract: if `agent_type` is renamed (or the plugin namespaced form changes) the
guard would silently stop guarding — see the contract canary in main().

Decision transport: a deny is the permissionDecision JSON on stdout with exit EXIT_DENY (43); an
allow is empty stdout with exit EXIT_ALLOW (42). The distinctive codes are how the hook tells THIS
guard's answer from a stand-in interpreter that merely exits 0 — see the comment at EXIT_ALLOW.
Anything else — including EXIT_INDETERMINATE (44), the deliberate answer for input the guard
cannot parse — is not an answer at all: the hook falls through to its raw guarded-agent match,
denying for guarded payloads and no-oping for everyone else.
The hook shell string translates them back to the documented exit-0 contract
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) before Claude Code sees anything.

# Agents this guard applies to — the read-only agents that still hold Bash. Both the namespaced
# form (how a plugin agent identifies itself) and the bare form (project/user scope) are guarded, so
# the guard cannot be sidestepped by installing the agent a different way.
# validate_fleet.py cross-checks this against agents/: hold Bash and you must be listed here.
#
# `principal-engineer` and `distinguished-architect` are here despite holding Write: their files
# promise "your Bash is inspection only" while their Write grant is legitimately for documents, and
# no tool boundary can split a doc from a source file. The Bash half, though, is exactly what this
# guard enforces, and their stated needs (git history, search, reading the current system) are
# already on the allowlist below — so the half that CAN be enforced now is. Their Write grant stays
# cooperative, and both files say so. Note validate_fleet.py only COMPELS guarding for a Bash-holder
# with no write tool; these two are here by choice, and the hook's own agent list is kept in sync by
# a validator rule (adding a name here without the hook would silently guard nothing).
#
# `repository-investigator` holds Bash solely for git history and revision identity (log, blame,
# show, rev-parse) and no write tool, so the validator compels its membership. Its local-only trust
# boundary survives the grant only because its SLICE of the allowlist carries no network command:
# the `gh` readers below are network fetches (PR bodies, issue text, `gh search code` results from
# arbitrary GitHub repositories), which is exactly the external content this role's trust split
# exists to keep out of the same context as private source. So the gh family is scoped to the
# roles whose remit includes PR context, via NETWORK_AGENT_NAMES below, rather than granted with the

# The hook must locate a Python at runtime (the plugin has no install step that could pin an

# If the hook simply took "exit 0 + empty stdout" as ALLOW, then ANY binary named `python3` that
# exits 0 — a PATH-planted shim, the Store stub on a bad day — would be accepted as the guard and
# would silently allow every command. So an ALLOW must be positively asserted with a code no
# accidental or hostile stand-in produces; the hook treats anything else as "this was not my guard"
# and moves to the next candidate interpreter, failing closed if none answers correctly.

# that (GOV-001: reproduced — the same guarded push that denies intact flipped to allow when the
# JSON was cut). Exiting with neither sentinel makes the hook treat this run like a stand-in
# interpreter's: it falls through to the fallback, which fails closed for guarded payloads and
# no-ops for everyone else. The value only needs to be not-42-and-not-43; it is pinned anyway so
