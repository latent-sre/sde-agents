"""PreToolUse live-effect gate — the managed gate homelab-engineer's prose promises, shipped.

Shipped by the sde-agents PLUGIN and registered through `hooks/hooks.json` as a second
`PreToolUse`/`Bash` hook, beside `readonly-guard.py`. Like the guard it is SESSION-WIDE and scopes
ITSELF: it no-ops unless the pending call's `agent_type` names a gated agent, and a plain main
loop — which carries no `agent_type` key — is never inspected. (The reasons a plugin agent cannot
carry its own `hooks:` are the guard docstring's; they are not restated here.)

WHY THIS EXISTS. `agents/homelab-engineer.md` executes an approved Tier 2/3 effect only through a
"managed gate": a host control that interposes a per-invocation human decision on the exact argv.
Before 2026-08-29 the agent was told to prove that control existed by "inspecting the effective
control for that argv" without invoking it. Claude Code exposes no such evaluation to the model
(the effective mode includes CLI flags it cannot see, and the settings files it can read are ones
it can also write), so the proof was unobtainable and the agent's own rule sent every live apply
to operator handoff. This hook replaces the proof with the mechanism: when the agent runs as the
plugin agent on Claude Code, this gate answers `ask` for every live-effect argv, so the host prompt
the operator sees IS the interposition, and running as the plugin agent is the evidence.

THE ROSTER IS DENYLIST-SHAPED, DELIBERATELY — the opposite of the guard, for a different job. The
guard enforces read-only, where a missed writer is a silent breach, so it enumerates readers. This
gate adds a fleet-owned prompt where the fleet KNOWS an effect is live; for anything unlisted the
host's own permission flow remains the floor, exactly as it was before this file existed. An
allowlist here would prompt on every Tier 1 `git commit` and `sed -i` and teach the operator to
click through. The roster grows by RECURRENCE: a lab incident or drill that shows an unlisted live
effect adds one entry with its transcript cited — never by exempting an entry.

PERMISSION MODE IS THE OTHER HALF. The payload carries `permission_mode`
(default|plan|acceptEdits|auto|dontAsk|bypassPermissions — code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Under
`bypassPermissions`, `dontAsk`, and `auto` no human answers a prompt, and a hook `deny` still wins
there (hooks-guide: deny beats every mode). So a live verb in a suppressed mode is DENIED with an
operator-handoff reason: the agent's text says bypass is not a decision, and this is the line
that makes it true. An ABSENT `permission_mode` is denied too — if the field is ever renamed
upstream, live effects stop loudly (every one hands off) instead of the gate quietly asking into
a session that suppresses the prompt. Readers never depend on the mode.

WHAT CANNOT BE BOUND, ASKS. A wrapper shell (`sh -c`, `eval`), command substitution, an
interactive `ssh` with no remote command, `find -exec`, `sudo -i`, or an unparseable quote cannot
be matched to one approved argv; the agent text forbids those forms for an approved effect, and
the gate asks rather than guessing.

Decision transport: exit EXIT_ALLOW (42) with empty stdout is "no decision"; EXIT_ASK (45) and
EXIT_DENY (43) print the permissionDecision JSON; EXIT_INDETERMINATE (44) is the answer for input
the gate cannot parse, and the hook shell then falls back to its raw agent match (a static ask, or
a static deny when the raw payload names a suppressed mode). The distinctive codes are how the
hook tells this gate's answer from a stand-in interpreter that merely exits 0; the shell string
translates them to the documented exit-0 contract. tests/test_live_effect_gate.py pins the codes
and PLUGIN_NAME to readonly-guard.py's, and tests/test_hook_wiring.py runs the shell string.

Honest boundary: this is a command filter, not a sandbox. It cannot see what a listed reader does
with a flag it did not consider, and it cannot see inside a script the agent wrote and then ran
(`python3 deploy.py` is not on the roster — the agent's own Tier discipline covers what it
authors). OS-level least privilege stays load-bearing.
